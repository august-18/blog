I'm a _ student interested in global health, and I'm  teaching myself R and statistics. This blog documents my learning and projects.

The blog title is inspired by [Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling), who taught me that data can be beautiful
*as well as all the other titans of data visualization, such as 
The title is also a reminder of xx's quote, 
because being beautiful is not enough. Data need to be functional, practical, and that means communicating a point clearly for actionable change.

This website was created with the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).

My process for creating this blog started with reading [Blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). There are a lot of how-to's online about setting up your own site, but I got confused by the number of alternative methods, and the fact that some older guides were unnecessarily complicated because more recent versions had made the process easier. The simplest descriptions I found for the bare minimum mechanics of getting a site up and running were:

<br>[Robert's guide](https://robertmylesmcdonnell.netlify.com/2018/01/03/blogdown-netlify/) was the simplest how-to. [Alison's guide](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) and [Amber's guide](https://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/) filled in details and provided ideas for next steps.
