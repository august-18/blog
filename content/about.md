I'm a medical student interested in global health, and I'm  teaching myself R and statistics. This blog documents my learning and projects.

The blog title is inspired by [Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling), and the quote by [William Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris), "Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful"

This website was created with the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
To develop it, I started by reading [Blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). There are a lot of how-to's online about setting up your own site, but I got confused by the number of alternative methods, and the fact that some older guides were unnecessarily complicated because more recent versions had made the process easier. The simplest descriptions I found for the bare minimum mechanics of getting a site up and running were:
<br>Git help:
<br>[Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/)
<br>[Hadley Wickham's advice on developing packages, section on Git](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html)

[Robert's guide](https://robertmylesmcdonnell.netlify.com/2018/01/03/blogdown-netlify/) was the simplest how-to. [Alison's guide](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) and [Amber's guide](https://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/) filled in details and provided ideas for next steps.

I eventually changed the default theme to ***
